# Build Status — cross-llm-delivery

> **Resume protocol (read this first every new sitting):**
> 1. Read this file — the "Next task" line tells you exactly where to start.
> 2. Read `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-cross-llm-delivery-master-plan.md` for the task detail.
> 3. Check the memory `cross-llm-delivery-project` for high-level context.
> 4. Do ONE task (or as many as the token budget allows), each ending in a commit + an update to this file.
> 5. Before stopping, update "Last updated", tick the task in the master plan, and set "Next task".

**Last updated:** 2026-06-09 (✅ COST GATE CLOSED = GO; Phases 2–3 built early by Gemini)

**Next task:** `T5.2` — Parallel fan-out (run a DAG batch's independent slices concurrently in separate worktrees, each judged; aggregate). **CLAUDE-DIRECT** per routing policy — concurrency + **quota-awareness** (throttle/Flash-fallback near the Pro cap) make it judgment-heavy. Uses T5.1 `parallel_batches` + T4.2 `run_plan`. Remaining: T5.3 (borderline), T6.1-6.3 (Claude). **16/20 done.**

> ✅ **COST GATE CLOSED = GO.** Decisive fact: Gemini runs on a **flat-rate plan** (Google AI Pro, A$32.99/mo) — billing is **quota %, not per-token** (CLI shows "Pro 24%, resets 12h"). So executor tokens are **$0 marginal**; the token-overhead finding (~98% input, non-amortizing) is economically **irrelevant** under flat billing. vs Opus-direct (~$0.42/bulk slice metered) Gemini wins decisively. Quality proven 4/4 grade A. **New constraint = quota/rate budget, not $:** make the orchestrator quota-aware (throttle/Flash-fallback near cap) for Phase 5 fan-out. See `docs/notes/cost-validation.md` → "COST GATE CLOSED".

> 🔀 **Routing policy (decided 2026-06-09): SELECTIVE dogfooding.** Use the product where it pays, not as ritual. **Dogfood (Gemini-dispatched, Claude authors contract + judges)** clean self-contained logic with a fully test-pinnable contract: **T4.1, T5.1**. **Claude writes directly** the judgment/concurrency/prose tasks: **T5.2** (parallel fan-out — needs quota-awareness), **T6.1/6.2/6.3** (skill packaging, docs, hook). **Borderline (decide at the time):** T4.2 (edits orchestrator.py), T5.3 (wires real verify/merge). Rationale: thesis proven 5/5 grade A; remaining bottleneck is contract-authoring+judging, so dispatch only when it's the cheaper path.
