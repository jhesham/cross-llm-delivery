# Build Status — cross-llm-delivery

> **Resume protocol (read this first every new sitting):**
> 1. Read this file — the "Next task" line tells you exactly where to start.
> 2. Read `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-cross-llm-delivery-master-plan.md` for the task detail.
> 3. Check the memory `cross-llm-delivery-project` for high-level context.
> 4. Do ONE task (or as many as the token budget allows), each ending in a commit + an update to this file.
> 5. Before stopping, update "Last updated", tick the task in the master plan, and set "Next task".

**Last updated:** 2026-06-09 (✅ COST GATE CLOSED = GO; Phases 2–3 built early by Gemini)

**Next task:** `T4.1` — Ledger schema (JSON: slice id → status done|pending|failed|in_progress, commit, attempts; atomic R/W; corruption-safe). Phase 2 & 3 complete. DOGFOOD candidate (clean self-contained logic). Phase 4 is the resumability the build hand-rolls via STATUS.md.

> ✅ **COST GATE CLOSED = GO.** Decisive fact: Gemini runs on a **flat-rate plan** (Google AI Pro, A$32.99/mo) — billing is **quota %, not per-token** (CLI shows "Pro 24%, resets 12h"). So executor tokens are **$0 marginal**; the token-overhead finding (~98% input, non-amortizing) is economically **irrelevant** under flat billing. vs Opus-direct (~$0.42/bulk slice metered) Gemini wins decisively. Quality proven 4/4 grade A. **New constraint = quota/rate budget, not $:** make the orchestrator quota-aware (throttle/Flash-fallback near cap) for Phase 5 fan-out. See `docs/notes/cost-validation.md` → "COST GATE CLOSED".
